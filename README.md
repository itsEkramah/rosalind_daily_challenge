 
# 🧬 Rosalind Daily Challenge

This repository documents my **daily journey of solving problems from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/)** – a platform for learning bioinformatics through programming challenges.  

The goal is to:
- Strengthen my **Python coding skills**  
- Apply programming concepts in a **bioinformatics context**  
- Build consistency by solving **at least one problem every day**  
- Create a public portfolio of **bioinformatics problem-solving**  

---

## 📅 Challenge Rules
1. Solve **1 Rosalind problem per day** (minimum).  
2. Write clean, well-documented Python code.  
3. Upload the solution file to GitHub with the problem name.  
4. Add a short note in the `Progress Log` section.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each script is named after the Rosalind problem ID (e.g., `dna.py`, `fib.py`, `gc.py`).
